<h2>olientation project</h2>
<h2>objectives of the olientation project</h2>
<ul type="square">
<li>to discover the diversity of the library system</li>
<li>to provide basic information on makerere/cocis library</li>
<li>to facilitate library research in accademic repertoire</li>
<li>to teach on how to use the library</li>
<li>to empasize on rules and regulations of the library</li>
<h2>process of development of the project</h2>
<h2>planning phase</h2><p>as a team we sat down and discussed several issues in planning for our project.these issues involved</p>
<ul><li> analysis of the two libraries makerere and COCIS library.</li>
<li>identifying and meeting of the people to help us in the project and many of these were the freshmen the owners of the project</li>
<li>defining the project scope analysing how far are we going to go about the project</li>
<li>setting of project goals and objective and this was more about the end results of the project</li>
<li>assignment of tasks and the tasks were divided among the five of us following the principle of management of division of work accordingly</li>
<li>carrying out risk assessment and the could be challenges in executing the task</li>
<h2>analysis phase</h2>
<li>gathering of information we gathered all information neccessary for the project that can easly explain the libraries and how they are used in the simplest way possible here we went on evaluating the website created for explaining more about the library </li>
<li>we also made research and analysis to determine the needs of the end users or the freshmen</li>
<h2>design phase</h2> here we made the plan into more logical structure that  later be implemented in a programming language.all operations that needed to be done were documented so that for any mistake done </li><li>we could refer easly</li>
<h2>development phase</h2>here we wrote the codes and built the application according to the designed decument</li>
<li>we went on specifying how our project or the final result will look like</li>
<h2>testing</h2>
<li>we tasted the developed project to see whether its working</li>
<li>we tested to clarify errors any find out diviation in case any</li>
<li>we tested to see the challanges that shall be faced by our end users the freshmen</li>
<a href="project.html"><h2>implementation</h2></a><li>after testing of the project and it has been working we impremented the final product of the project that shall be used by our fresh men in orienting the two libraries</li>



</ul>

<h2>in the planning phase</h2>
<p>we identified the materials and requirements to use and these includes the images and and maps to help in directing and distinguishing,computer,books and pens, camera to capture pictures vedio editor to edit vedios, web browsers and search engines like you tube for more information on these libraries</p>
<p>we i dentified the methods of collecting data and the people to help us collect the required data. here we used questionnares, focus groups and interviews to collect our data and the questions used include the following</p>
<ol><li>which mean of learning shall be favourable to the freshmen?</li>
<li>which area in library usage is best important to be known to freshmen?</li>
<li>have the freshmen ever visited any of these libraries before?</li>
<li>do freshmen ever had any introduction about these libraries before?</li> 
<li>whats the personal perceptions of the libraries among the freshmen</li>
<li>what else do freshmen want to learn about the library</li>
<li>what are the resources to use</li>
</ol>
<h2>survey phase</h2><p>we made survey on the past years olientation document which helped us with the go ahead. we also made survey on the libraries themselves and the website of the university library we made survey on the needs of the freshmen and we found that<br>they require an intresting product which is not boring</br>
they need a project that is on topic
<br>they need a project that would be easily accessed whenever wants to refer to it</br>
they need a project that is colourful and intresting
<br>they need a project that combines multimedias like having vedios,images,sound,graphics text and many others</br>these were the outcomes of the research made from seven freshmen and the freshmen interviewed and questioned include <br>Nabuuma Nusurah</br> Nambi Jackie and other five</p>

</p>
</ol>

<a href="for more information.html"><h2>resources found useful</h2></a>
<p>the website for makerere main library was found useful and could teach and elaborate more about the library in suplement to the olientation project.</p>
